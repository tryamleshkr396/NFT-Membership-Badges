# NftMembershipBadges

## Project Description
NftMembershipBadges is a decentralized application that allows organizations to issue NFT-based membership badges. These badges can represent various membership tiers and grant exclusive access or rewards.

## Project Vision
To create a transparent and decentralized membership ecosystem where badges are verifiable, transferable, and owned by members â€” not centralized authorities.

## Key Features
- Mint NFT-based membership badges.
- Assign tier-based benefits and metadata.
- Transfer or revoke badges if required.
- Fully on-chain verification of membership status.

## Future Scope
- Integration with DAO systems for voting rights.
- On-chain upgradeable membership tiers.
- Marketplace integration for badge trading.
